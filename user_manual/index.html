<h3 id="where-to-get-help">Where to get help</h3>
<body> If you're just getting started using Rodan, be sure to consult the documentation and wikis on both <a href="https://github.com/DDMAL/Rodan/wiki">the Rodan home wiki</a> as well as the documentation for beginners, advanced users, and developers which can be found <a href"https://github.com/DDMAL/e2e-omr-resources/wiki">on the end to end documentation wiki page</a></body>
<h3 id="getting-a-user-account">Getting a user account</h3>
<body> Navigate to the "register" button and click. It will prompt you to sill out your information, and then to wait on a confirmation email. This may take a few moments. Be sure to check your junkmail if it still has not arrived in about 5 minutes. If 5 or so minutes have passed with nothing, feel free to request another activation email.</body>
<h3 id="projects-resources-and-workflows">Projects, Resources, and Workflows</h3>
<body> To start a project, navigate to and click on the blue 'create new project' button, which will open a dialogue box and allow you to enter a name for your project. </body>
<body> <b>Resources</b> are the files, such as images, you will upload for training. As items are generated via the workflows and jobs, those will also show up here. Such generated files, particularly the ZIP files, will be exceptionally relevant later on.</body>
<body> Workflows are the step by step processes through which the images you upload will be prepared for training stages, the blocks which will make up the training stage, classifying stage, and so on. Later stages will be somewhat more involved. You will be able to make your own workflows, as well as import workflows from other projects, and previous projects of your own if you so choose.</body>
<h3 id="importing-resources">Importing Resources</h3>
<body>This can be done by navigating to the resources tab and selecting the 'upload resources' button. For manuscripts images, we highly recommend items in the IIIF format, or extracted from a IIIF manifest. You are able to upload multiple resources at the same time by pressing shift + the relevant files you would like to selected by clicking on them (shift+click), or using your arrows keys (shift+up/down).</body>
<h3 id="creating-workflows">Creating Workflows</h3>
<body>Create a new workflow by selecting the 'create new workflow' button. If you have a workflow from a previous project, or one has been shared with you, you can also <b>import a workflow from file</b>, which you can do via the button to the right. Once selected, a small dialogue box will open, and a new line will appear in the window, with 'untitled' as its name. This is the new workflow! Double click, and you will then be taken to a new screen. Right click on the grid-space, and select "add-edit description". Here you can rename your workflow to something clear (perhaps related to your current stage), and detail whatever other relevant information you have in the description below. Save, and then proceed to importing jobs! For more details, please refer to the documentation linked above.</body>
